# Ocumeda-KPI
The purpose of the Python script is to streamline the process of collecting exam data from the Ocumeda platform and generating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Eye Screening application. These KPIs are then compiled into a `screening_kpi.csv` file for storage.

It's worth noting that much of the code utilized in the script has been reused from Ocumeda's own [DataFlow](https://github.com/ocumeda/DataFlow) repository, allowing for a more efficient and effective solution.
